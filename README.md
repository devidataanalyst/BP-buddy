🩺 BP Buddy
BP Buddy is a simple Python application built to help track, monitor, and manage patients’ blood-pressure readings. 
Created as a learning project for Stanford’s Code in Place 2025,
BP Buddy reflects my growth in Python programming—combining logic, data handling, and user interaction in a practical, health-focused application.
